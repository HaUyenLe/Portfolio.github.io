    <article><center><p1>Bio</p1></center>
      <center><p4>Ha Uyen Le is an artist born in Bac Lieu, Vietnam and raised in San Jose, California. Before moving to the U.S in 2nd grade, she lived in Vietnam where she often visits her relatives in the countryside where she grows to love nature and it open and vast sceneries. This love of nature influences her art works. She discovered her love for art in kindergarten when she participated in her school art completion where she created her first ever artwork of a landscape out of playdoh. As someone who is shy and introverted, art is her source of communication and a way to release her stress. Her medium of choice is pencil and color pencil because it was always available for her since was young and is the medium that she is most comfortable with. </p4></center>
      <center><p3>Statement</p3></center>
      <center><p5>My works usually involve nature, landscapes, and still life. I push myself to create artworks with various medium but Iâ€™m often fond of working with paint and graphite. As someone who is introverted and live in a large city filled with people in San Jose, my arts are my escape from the busy city and suffocating life style. Therefore, most often my works revolves around nature and landscapes as it allows me to completely submerge myself into my imagination and travel away from my busy life. For some people, still life can be very boring but for me it is away for me to completely lose myself and focus on my work and completely forget my worries from the outside world. Therefore, I produce a lot of still life works. As a person who is fond of nature, I also produce works addressing environmental issues such as Global Warming and Ocean Pollution.</p5></center></article>
